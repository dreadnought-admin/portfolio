        <h1>Hi, I'm Dom.</h1>
        <h3>Wait. I think I already said that.</h3>
        <p>I'm a full-stack developer who has a penchant for React, TS, and ternary operators.</p>
        <p>In July of 2022 I tore my ACL and subsequently my quadriceps tendon while fighting 
          in the sport, I love, Muay Thai. It <em>pivoted</em> the direction of my life dramatically. Get it? 'Pivot'? 
          Because I can't do that anymore.</p>
        <p>I went from a career in the hospitality industry as a bartender to being unable to walk properly over the course of 24 hours. 
          With all of the time I had to sit around and feel sorry for myself, I ended up discovering my affinity for programming. 
          It complimented other aspects of my life, such as my tendency to sit in dark rooms all day staring at my screen and having lower-back problems.
        </p>
        <p>In February 2023 I graduated from Flatiron School's full-stack software engineering programâ€”but I certainly haven't stopped there.
          Through their cirriculum I discovered my affinity for React and we have been awful friends and dear enemies ever since.
